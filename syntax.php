    <h2>Basic Syntax of PHP</h2>
    <p>PHP code is executed on the server, and the result is returned to the browser as plain HTML. Here is an example of a simple PHP script:</p>
    <pre>
        <code>
&lt;?php
echo "Hello, World!";
?&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>PHP scripts are enclosed in &lt;?php and ?&gt; tags. The echo statement is used to output text to the browser.</p>
